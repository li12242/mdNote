###3.6 Finite-element methods in two space dimensions
###3.7 Open-boundary conditions
the linearized shallow-water equations in one space dimension as the equations for evolution of small disturbances from a uniform stream with speed U
$$\begin{matrix}
u_t+Uu_x+gh_x=0 \cr
h_t+Uh_x+Hu_x=0 \end{matrix}$$

特征速度（characteristic velocities）与 Riemann invariants

开边界独立变量个数与边界上特征线传入该区域的条数相同

* $|U|<c_0$ 流动称为subcritical
* $|U|>c_0$ 流动称为supercritical
