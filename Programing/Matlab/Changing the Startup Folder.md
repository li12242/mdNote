# Changing the Startup Folder

Changing the Startup Folder
Starting in R2014b, you can change the startup folder using the General Preferences panel. On the Home tab, in the Environment section, click Preferences. Select MATLAB > General. Choose an option for the Initial working folder.

By default, the initial working folder is set to Location based on MATLAB startup rules.
